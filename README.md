# Celebrity Face Recognition
 
This project is a celebrity face recognition system that identifies and classifies images of celebrities. The system uses machine learning algorithms to analyze facial features and match them with known celebrities.

## Features
* Data Cleaning: The project uses Python, NumPy, and OpenCV for data cleaning, preprocessing, and feature extraction from images.
* Data Visualization: Matplotlib and Seaborn are used for visualizing data, including facial landmarks, image histograms, and more.
* Model Building: The system uses the Scikit-learn library for building machine learning models, such as Support Vector Machines (SVM), Decision Trees, or Random Forests.
* IDE: The project can be developed using Jupyter Notebook, Visual Studio Code, or PyCharm.
* HTTP Server: Python Flask is used to create an HTTP server for hosting the face recognition system.
* UI Development: The user interface (UI) is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for a user-friendly experience.
